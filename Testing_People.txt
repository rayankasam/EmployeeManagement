When most people are asked if “all-nighters” are beneficial for learning, they say no. But when asked why, they bring the argument that sleep is essential and the more energy you have, the better quality work you do. Is this true? Well, is it true that having more energy leads to more quality work? Research says it does make sense, but it also says the night is probably the best time to work. Why? At night, you have a lot of time. People usually have obligations at day-time, and only around two hours to work. At night, (assuming night starts at 9 pm) you can easily grab around five hours of work. However, this takes us back to the “more energy equals better quality” statement. If this is true, would two hours of “energetic work” be more efficient than five “tired” hours of work? Probably not. If you’re still not convinced, try this on for size. If you have an assignment due the next day, you’re going to be alert worrying about it the whole night. That means your brain is going to be on the alert, careful, energetic for that night, and we all know that more energy equals better quality work, no? Do you need one more solid reason? Staying awake that whole night finishing your work whilst getting good grades makes you feel charismatic about all-nighters, eventually leading to more efficient all-nighters. Now, if all-nighters are beneficial for learning, does that mean doing your work as all-nighters is the best? Surprisingly, no. To be proactive and get all your work done on time, you need to plan when to do all-nighters and when not to. Why not just do an all-nighter every day? Because then you’d sleep in the mornings, and what good is a presentation if you can’t present it? However, if you space your time out well, and don’t procrastinate, you should be able to do the following. First, you should be able to have at least two hours of study time every day. Then, you need to have to devote one day of your weekend. Now, just sit back and enjoy. How does this work? Well, if you have two hours to study every day, you have ten hours (excluding the weekends). Ten hours is a lot of time, but if you still have work, imagine a whole day without school taking up time. That whole day should be enough time. Then again, the factor of procrastination comes up. It’s very easy to say “don’t procrastinate” but is it really as easy as it sounds? Your brain occasionally tricks you into a false sense of safety, thinking that you have enough time. This is where all-nighters come into play. During an all-nighter you are alert, making the brain tell you “This is important!” so you won’t procrastinate leading to you getting sleep faster. Looking at all of this information, are all-nighters beneficial for learning? The answer is relative; take a look at your schedule. It’s going to be different than mine, your’s or anyone else’s. The better question is, are all-nighters beneficial for you?
